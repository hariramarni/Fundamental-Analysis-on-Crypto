Team (7/10)
1.	Dmitrii Fresco
•	DevX at Moonbeam network.
•	Also worked with AiMi and Microsoft with a relatively decent background.

I’m happy with the team as they regularly keep up with the community on LinkedIn.

Note- I’m not able to track most of the employees on Linkedin because I don’t have many connections. Therefore restricting me from looking at many profiles.

Backers (5/10)

•	PureStake announced the completion of a $1.4 million seed round led by Hypersphere Ventures, a venture firm focused on Polkadot founded by Polkadot co-founder Robert Habermeier. Other notable participants include Arrington XRP Capital, HashKey, KR1, Bitcoin.com Exchange, and Du Capital. The funding will accelerate the development of the Moonbeam network and a Polkadot para chain focused on interoperability.
•	KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$100,000 in the Moonbeam Network project.

Product market fit (7/10)
AIM
For many developers and projects, an Ethereum-compatible smart contract approach will be much simpler and faster to implement. And by building these smart contracts on Moonbeam, developers can still integrate with other chains and get value from Polkadot-based network effects.

Who Benefits From Moonbeam:-
1.	Existing Ethereum-Based Projects
Projects that are struggling with cost and scalability challenges on Ethereum can use Moonbeam.
•	Implement a hybrid approach, where applications live on both Ethereum and Moonbeam simultaneously.
1.	Polkadot Ecosystem Projects
Ecosystem projects that need smart contract functionality can use Moonbeam.
•	For example, they could create a place where teams can crowdfund their projects, implement lock drops, and process other, more complex financial transactions than are provided by base Substrate functionality.
1.	Developers of New DApps
Individuals and teams that want to try building on Polkadot can use Moonbeam.
•	Leverage the specialized functionality from Polkadot para chains while reaching users and assets on other chains.

Key Features
o	Decentralized and Permissionless.
o	Contains a Full EVM Implementation.
o	Implements the Web3 RPC API.
o	Compatible with the Substrate Ecosystem Toolset.
o	Native Cross-Chain Integration.
o	On-Chain Governance.
